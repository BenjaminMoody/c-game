The download will be called c-game.zip, After unzipping this file into a new file of your choosing, open the .exe file called "And_life_goes_on.exe". This will open a terminal you can play the game within.
If you wish to compile this game for yourself I recommend visual studio code with c/c++ installed and a gcc connection set up. Fork this project and copy the repository to your vsc application. Then by pressing the play button while in the "And_life_goes_on.c" file the compiler will create a .exe file of the same name, Enjoy!
